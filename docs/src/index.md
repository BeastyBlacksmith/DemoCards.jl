# DemoCards

Welcome to the gallery of demos!

To start with, all you need is well-organized demo files:

```text
simplest_demos
└── basic
    ├── demo_1.md
    ├── demo_2.md
    ├── demo_3.md
    ├── demo_4.md
    ├── demo_5.md
    ├── demo_6.md
    ├── demo_7.md
    └── demo_8.md
```

and the rules are simple:

* The root folder holds the demo page,
* each subfolder stands for a section/subsection,
* each `.md` file is a complete demo.

This package generates the [simplest demopage](@ref simplest_demopage) for you.
