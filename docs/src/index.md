# DemoCards

Welcome to the gallery of demos!

To start with, all you need is well-organized demo files:

```text
simplest_demos/
├── advanced
│   ├── demo_3.md
│   └── demo_4.md
└── basic
    ├── demo_1.md
    └── demo_2.md
```

and the rules are simple:

* The root folder holds the demo page,
* each subfolder stands for a section/subsection,
* each `.md` file is a complete demo.

This package generates the [simplest demos](@ref simplest_demos) for you.
