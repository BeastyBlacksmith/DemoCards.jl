# [Quick Start](@id quickstart)

This section describes how you can set up your demos easily.

## Manage your demo files

The rules are simple:

* you need one demo page to hold all the demos
* a [demo page](@ref concepts_page) has several [demo sections](@ref concepts_section)
* a demo section either
    * has other demo sections as nested subsections, or,
    * has the [demo files](@ref concepts_card).

In the following example:

* we have one demo page: "simplest_demopage"
* "simplest_demopage" has one demo sections: "dependencies"
* "dependencies" has two demo subsections: "part1" and "part2"
* "part1" and "part2" holds all the demo files

```@setup simplest_demopage
using DemoCards
using DemoCards: DemoPage
root = "../demos/simplest_demopage"
```

```@repl simplest_demopage
run(`tree $(root) -L 3`);
DemoPage(root)
```

## Deploy your demo page

Deployment is also very simple:

1. create a demopage using `makedemos`
2. load a style sheet using `cardtheme`
3. pass the result to `Documenter`

```julia
theme = cardtheme()
demopage = makedemos("demos/simplest_demopage") # relative path to docs/

format = Documenter.HTML(edit_branch = "master",
                         assets = [theme, ])
makedocs(format = format,
         pages = [
            "Home" => "index.md",
            "Examples" => demopage,
         ],
         sitename = "Awesome demos")
```

After it's set up, you can now focus on contributing more demos. For other
works, you can leave it to `DemoCards.jl` :D

Check the [Simplest Demopage](@ref simplest_demopage) to see how this page
looks with the minimal configuration.

## What DemoCards.jl does

The pipeline of [`makedemos`](@ref DemoCards.makedemos) is:

1. analyze the structure of your demo folder and extracts configuration information
2. copy assets without processing
3. preprocess demo files and save it
4. process and save cover images

Since all files are generated to `docs/src`, the next step is to leave everything else
to `Documenter.jl` ðŸ˜ƒ

!!! tip

    By default, `makedemos` generates all necessary files to `docs/src/democards`,
    so it's recommended to add it to the `.gitignore` of your project.

!!! warning

    Currently, there's no guarantee that this function works for untypical
    documentation folder structure. By *typical*, it is:

    ```text
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ Project.toml
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demos
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ make.jl
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Project.toml
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ test
    ```

For advanced usage of `DemoCards.jl`, you need to understand the core [concepts](@ref concepts) of it.
